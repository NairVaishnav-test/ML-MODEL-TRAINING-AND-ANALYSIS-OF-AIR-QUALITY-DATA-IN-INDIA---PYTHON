# ML-MODEL-TRAINING-AND-ANALYSIS-OF-AIR-QUALITY-DATA-IN-INDIA---PYTHON
Built supervised machine learning models to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) in India using pollutant data. Applied preprocessing, feature selection, and algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM. Evaluated model performance to identify the most accurate model for AQI forecasting and analysis.


The following project is a supervised classification based project to predict the Air Quality of cities in India. A streamlit model has also been deployed for this project and all of the data and code for the project is provided in the ML_data.zip folder. If you wish to run the project, you can simply extract the files and figure out the rest yourself. If you cannot manage to figure out how to run the files yourself, then there is no point in using this project for whatever assignment you have. All I will say is use VSCode for it. Good Luck
